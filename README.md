<h1>CaptureWord<p>By Benji Paquette</p></h1>

<p>For my project, I decided to make a clone of the game Catchphrase, creatively naming it "CaptureWord." I started out in onshape not knowing exectly how I was goining to make my design, just that it would look like the game, made up of two 3d printed shells that would be screwed together. My first designs, however, did not look very good. After I disqualified using a revolve, for unknown reasons, I dove into increasingly complex ways to produce a less than satisfactory result.</p>

<p>After spending some time on it, I finally conceded and decided to use a revolve, which worked amazingly, making me unsure why I didn't do it in the first place</p>

<p>I then proceeded to add all of the bits I needed to use it in my project</p>

<p><em>All finished?...</em></p>

<p> After that, I was ready to work on assembly and code, or so I thought. However, it turned out, for a myriad number of reasons, that I would not be able to 3d print my project, instead having to use the laser cutter.</p>

<p>I opted to switch to a hexagonal prism instead, and was able to get most of it switched over pretty quickly, just changing the first sketch and the revolve. There were a few peices, however that defied me, and I struggled on them for many weeks before finally giving up or figuring out a solution</p>

<p>The two that defied me the longest were the battery holder and the LCD mount. In my original design, the battery holder was a box, reccessed into the shell, with a hole for the wires. Without 3d printing it, there was no way to have a reccesed box like that, but I kept on trying to do it for many a day, as it would make it hard tro rest the game on a surface and still see the top. Eventually however, I gave in and just cut holes for the screws and the wiring on the bottom.</p>
