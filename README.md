<h1>CaptureWord<p style="font-size: 20px">By Benji Paquette</p></h1>

<p>For my project, I decided to make a clone of the game Catchphrase, creatively naming it "CaptureWord." I started out in onshape not knowing exectly how I was goining to make my design, just that it would look like the game, made up of two 3d printed shells that would be screwed together. My first designs, however, did not look very good. After I disqualified using a revolve, for unknown reasons, I dove into increasingly complex ways to produce a less than satisfactory result.</p>
